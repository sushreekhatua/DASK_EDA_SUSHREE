# Dask_EDA_Sushree
  Dask DataFrame is used in situations where Pandas is commonly needed, usually when Pandas fails due to data size or computation speed.So for the dataset named as "**Brazil Weather Automatic Stations (2000-2021)**",I used Dask-Dataframe because of it's data size .I  did  exploratory data analysis and data-visualization.
